# Distance Measurement System using ATmega32 and HC-SR04

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design a distance measurement system using an ATmega32 microcontroller and an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor. The system will measure the distance using the sensor and display the result on an LCD.

## Project Components
The project involves the following components:

- ATmega32 Microcontroller
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- LCD

Each component has specific requirements and specifications, including clock frequency, data communication protocols, and pin configurations.

## Project Logic
The project logic follows these steps:

1. The microcontroller triggers the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor to send an ultrasonic pulse.
2. The sensor emits ultrasonic waves, which bounce off an object and return to the sensor.
3. The microcontroller measures the time taken for the ultrasonic waves to return and calculates the distance based on the speed of sound.
4. The calculated distance is displayed on the LCD screen.

## Project Architecture
The project should be designed and implemented based on a layered architecture model. Each component, including drivers, should have its own set of functions and inputs to ensure modularity and scalability.
